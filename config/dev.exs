# ## SSL Support
#
# In order to use HTTPS in development, a self-signed
# certificate can be generated by running the following
# command from your terminal:
#
#     openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=US/ST=Denial/L=Springfield/O=Dis/CN=www.example.com" -keyout priv/server.key -out priv/server.pem
#
# The `http:` config above can be replaced with:
#
#     https: [port: 4000, keyfile: "priv/server.key", certfile: "priv/server.pem"],
#
# If desired, both `http:` and `https:` keys can be
# configured to run both http and https servers on
# different ports.

# Do not include metadata nor timestamps in development logs
config :logger, :console, format: "[$level] $message\n"

# # Alternative logger configuration
# # tell logger to load a LoggerFileBackend processes
# config :logger, backends: [{LoggerFileBackend, :error_log}]

# # configuration for the {LoggerFileBackend, :error_log} backend
# config :logger, :error_log,
#   path: "log/app.log",
#   level: :info,
#   truncate: :infinity

# in production as building large stacktraces may be expensive.
